[TheOdinProject Project Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

## The Layout

1. Get user choice via `prompt()`
2. Get the computer's choice via `getComputerChoice` - 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'
3. Standardise the user and computer choices by making them lowercase
4. Compute the result in `playRound()` -- R>S, P>R, S>P & Ties -- return the result, player score, and computer score
5. Use the `playGame()` function for playing five rounds (with or without loops)
